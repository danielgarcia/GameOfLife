Conway's Game of Life
-------
The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.



Objective
-------
Messing around with Objective C and Kobold2D.

I used an already built version of the Game of Life in Java ( [Source Code](https://s3.amazonaws.com/mgwu/tutorial/TheGameOfLife.java) ) and translated it into Objective C.
